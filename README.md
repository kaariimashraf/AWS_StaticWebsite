### This Project is to demonstrate Fundamental Concepts of AWS Cloud.By Karim Ashraf For Udacity

This project has two major intentions to implement:
1- Hosting a static website on S3.
2- Accessing the cached website pages using CloudFront content delivery network (CDN) service.
   CloudFront offers low latency and high transfer speeds during website rendering.

#### To deploy a static website to AWS by performing the following steps:
1- create a public S3 bucket and upload the website files to your bucket.

2- configure the bucket for website hosting and secure it using IAM policies.

3- speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront.

4- access your website in a browser using the unique CloudFront endpoint.
